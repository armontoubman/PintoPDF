## Synopsis

PintoPDF is a GUI tool for 1) extracting pages from PDF files and 2) merging PDF files.

## Motivation

I needed this, and I wanted to use Python 3 and tkinter.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.
Install dependencies (PyPDF2): `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
The tkinter (8.6) library may or may not already come with your Python 3 distribution.

Clone the repository, and use `python3 pintopdf.py` to start.

On Windows, use `python setup.py py2exe` to build an executable.

On OS X, use `python setup.py py2app` to build an app bundle.
